# Music-generation-using-LSTM
Music and Machine learning are the 2 fields I spend most of my time on.I always dreamt of combining these 2 domains and create something.

Finally this is a project that uses Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks to read and analyze patterns in piano melodies that I gave the model as input for training.

After training for 200 epochs ,I gave the model a sample melody as a initiation based on which the model generated its own music.

This is the model output
